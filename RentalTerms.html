Royal Car Rental may have other requirements and policies. The requirements and policies of the local rental office will 
control when different from those listed here. Check the localterms and conditions posted on the web page of the renting 
location for more information about their local rental policies or terms and conditions.

<p style="color:#ffff66;"><b>1. Driver’s License:</b></p>
<u>Sri Lanka Residents and Sri Lanka Military Personnel:</u>
A renter, additional renter, or authorized additional driver who is a resident of Sri Lanka, must present at the time of 
rental a driver's license issued by the government that is valid for the entire rental period.

<u>International Driver’s License:</u>
A renter, additional renter, or authorized additional driver who is a resident of a country outside Sri Lanka, must present 
at the time of rental a driver's license issued by the country of residence that is valid for the entire rental period. If 
the driver’s license in not in English, the renter and any additional renters or drivers will be required to present both 
the foreign issued driver’s license and a current International Driver’s Permit (“IDP”); or, if from Japan, a Japanese 
Translation Service. An IDP does not give a person the right to drive, but provides a certified translation of the valid 
foreign driver’s license. An IDP can be obtained in the driver's country of residence only with a valid driver’s license. 
An IDP (or certified translation) without the foreign issued driver’s license is not acceptable. The renter, additional renter, 
or authorized additional driver may be requested to show a passport, visa or other current Sri Lanka issued documentation at 
the beginning of the rental authorizing each person to be present in Sri Lanka for the entire rental period.

<p style="color:#ffff66;"><b>2. Age of Renters:</b></p>
The minimum age to rent a vehicle at Royal Car Rental locations is 21 years of age. In certain instances, renters under 21 years 
old will be permitted to rent vehicles but will be subjected to an underage fee based on additional insurance risk. Renters, 
additional renters and or authorized additional drivers that are 21 to 24 years of age will be charged an underage 25 driver fee 
because of such driver's age and in addition to any additional driver fee, if applicable. Renters 21 to 24 years of age are permitted 
to rent only Economy through Full Size Vehicles, Intermediate SUVs, Mini Vans, Work Pick-up Trucks, Cargo Vans and Cargo Trucks.

<p style="color:#ffff66;"><b>3. Gasoline and Refueling Charges:</b></p>
The renter must refill the fuel tank to the same level as when the vehicle was rented. Renters do not return the vehicle at the same 
fuel level as when rented, with a re-fueling receipt with 10 miles, will be required to pay a fuel charge for the cost and service 
of refueling the vehicle. The fuel charge is based on the estimated number of gallons needed to refill the tank multiplied by the rate 
per gallon charge specified on the rental agreement plus a refueling convenience fee.

<p style="color:#ffff66;"><b>4. Rental Rates:</b></p>
Most Rental rates are based on a 24 hour "rental day" starting at the time of rental. The minimum charge is one day, plus mileage, if

until the vehicle is returned, up to the applicable daily rate. Mileage charges, if applicable, will be the number of miles driven as 
determined by the odometer readings at the beginning and end of the rental. If the renter fails to comply with the minimum or maximum

rate plan may be charge.Calendar day pricing will be disclosed when in effect.

<p style="color:#ffff66;"><b>5. Geographic Driving Limits:</b></p>

Typically when people get their rental agreement they sign it and stick it in the glove compartment and won't see it again 
until they bring the vehicle back. At Rotal Car Rental we make it easy. On this page are the basic issues covered on the rental 
agreement. Everything from keeping the vehicle longer to what your responsibilities are as a renter. Simply click on one of the 
items on the right or scroll down the page to read the information about a particular issue. Because we value our customers, we 
have taken great care in presenting these guidelines in a clear and concise manner that isn't cluttered with industry jargon and 
legalese. We have no hidden rules or "surprise" guidelines. As Royal Car Rental is in the communication business as well as the 
customer service business we want to communicate to our customers information concerning our vehicles, availability, rates, 
qualifications to rent, options concerning additional coverage’s, just to name a few. It is also our responsibility to inform each 
customer of their responsibilities while renting.

advantage of the best possible rate we can offer. </li>
<li>Royal Car Rental Rent daily charges are on a 24 hour clock. Example: If you rent the vehicle at 10:00 a.m. on a Monday and 
return at 10:00 a.m. the next day, which would be  Tuesday,this would be considered a one day charge. Renters are given 
a 59-minute grace period to return. After such time the renter would be charged an hourly rate for each hour. All items charged

coverage, personal accident coverage, additional renter fee, etc.</li>

<li>Know what you need before you arrive. Royal Car Rental does not require renters to purchase any additional

being rented would determine your coverage. Again we suggest that you never assume and encourage you to call the 
toll-free number on your credit card to verify your coverage.</li>
